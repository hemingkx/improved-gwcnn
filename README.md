This reposity contains all the codes to reproduce the results for our paper:  [Improved deep learning techniques in gravitational-wave data analysis](https://journals.aps.org/prd/accepted/50070Q98Lb711a2f638578f4ab6f60edc4ca19ec6) by H Xia et al. (2020) [[arxiv:2011.04418](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.04418)].

## Dataset Generation

Our codes to generate gravitational-wave data are based on the open source tool [ggwd](https://github.com/timothygebhard/ggwd) for paper [*Convolutional neural networks: a magic bullet for gravitational-wave detection?*](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.100.063015) [[arXiv:1904.08693](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08693)]. For details of using this tool, please check `README.md` in `./ggwd`.
